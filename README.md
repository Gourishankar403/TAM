                               #### User login and password########
1. For the first question to address the need of a more efficient username and password mechanism , i have come up with a simple yet powerful system to increase the safety of users, The time taken by each individual to type his/her password is different.
   Assuming that the system stores information about the average time taken by each individual , it can predict if it is user who is entering it or not, this will improve security both physically and on online platform adding time constraint will be a powerful way to increase the strenght of security . if the user is valid but cant access the site /app ,then an email will be sent for futher instructions . Ai integration to the code can be useful in differentiating between the users based on the most trivial difference in the timing between two individuals, This will allow a large number of users to use the sytem.
                            ####### Fake news issue#########

   For the problem faced by organizations regarding  Fake news, i have attempted at creating a solution based on the storage of common fake news titles in the modern world. if the heading entered by the user is stored as fake news then a warning message will be generated and a also based on the users choice a list of internationally valid news websites (along with their URLs) will  be given to the user.If the title entered doesn't have a fake news touch , still the user can choose to validate by choosing from the set of URLs that will be displayed .
