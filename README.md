                               #### User login and password########
1. For the first question to address the need of a more efficient username and password mechanism , i have come up with a simple yet powerful system to increase the safety of users, The time taken by each individual to type his/her password is different.
   Assuming that the system stores information about the average time taken by each individual , it can predict if it is user who is entering it or not, this will improve security both physically and on online platform adding time constraint will be a powerful way to increase the strenght of security . if the user is valid but cant access the site /app ,then an email will be sent for futher instructions .
